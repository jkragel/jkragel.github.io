Evidence from functional neuroimaging and invasive recordings in humans suggest that reinstatement organizes our memories by time or content, yet the neural systems involved in reinstating these unique types of information remain unclear. Here, combining computational modeling and intracranial recordings from 69 epilepsy patients, we show that two cortical systems uniquely reinstate the semantic content and temporal context of previously studied items during free recall. Examining either the posterior medial or anterior temporal networks, we find that forward encoding models trained on the brain‚Äôs response to the temporal and semantic attributes of items can predict the serial position and semantic category of unseen items. During memory recall, these models uniquely link reinstatement of temporal context and semantic content to these posterior and anterior networks, respectively. These findings demonstrate how specialized cortical systems enable the human brain to target specific memories.","tags":["Retrieved Context"],"title":"Distinct cortical systems reinstate the content and context of episodic memories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Melissa Hebscher","James Kragel","Thorsten Kahnt","Joel L Voss"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"479b56afb045900fda40318225f3b38e","permalink":"https://jkragel.github.io/publication/2021-01-01_hebscher2021enhanced/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-01-01_hebscher2021enhanced/","section":"publication","summary":"Episodic memory involves the reinstatement of distributed patterns of brain activity present when events were initially experienced. The hippocampus is thought to coordinate reinstatement via its interactions with a network of brain regions, but this hypothesis has not been causally tested in humans. The current study directly tested the involvement of the hippocampal network in reinstatement using network-targeted noninvasive stimulation. We measured reinstatement of multi-voxel patterns of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity during encoding and retrieval of naturalistic video clips depicting everyday activities. Reinstatement of video-specific activity patterns was robust in posterior parietal and occipital areas previously implicated in event reinstatement. Theta-burst stimulation targeting the hippocampal network increased video-specific reinstatement of fMRI activity patterns in occipital cortex and improved memory accuracy relative to stimulation of a control out-of-network location. Furthermore, stimulation targeting the hippocampal network influenced the trial-by-trial relationship between hippocampal activity during encoding and later reinstatement in occipital cortex. These findings implicate the hippocampal network in the reinstatement of spatially distributed patterns of event-specific activity and identify a role for the hippocampus in encoding complex naturalistic events that later undergo cortical reinstatement.","tags":["Brain Stimulation"],"title":"Enhanced reinstatement of naturalistic event memories due to hippocampal-network-targeted stimulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James Kragel","Stephan Schuele","Stephen VanHaerents","Joshua M.

We tested the counterintuitive theory that the hippocampus contributes to long-term memory through remarkably short-term processing, as reflected in eye movements during scene encoding. While viewing scenes for the first time, short-term retrieval operative within the episode over only hundreds of milliseconds was indicated by a specific eye-movement pattern, which was effective in that it enhanced spatiotemporal memory formation. This viewing pattern was predicted by hippocampal theta oscillations recorded from depth electrodes and by shifts toward top-down influence of hippocampal theta on activity within visual perception and attention networks. The hippocampus thus supports short-term memory processing that coordinates behavior in the service of effective spatiotemporal learning.","tags":["Visual Exploration"],"title":"Rapid coordination of effective learning by the human hippocampus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James Kragel","Joel L.

Cognitive models derived from list-learning experiments attribute this structure to the retrieval of temporal context information that indicates when a memory occurred. These models predict key features of memory recall, such as the strong tendency to retrieve studied items in the order in which they were first encountered. Can such models explain ecological memory behaviors, such as eye movements during encoding and retrieval of complex visual stimuli? We tested predictions from retrieved-context models using three data sets involving recognition memory and free viewing of complex scenes. Subjects reinstated sequences of eye movements from one scene-viewing episode to the next. Moreover, sequence reinstatement decayed over time and was associated with successful memory. We observed memory-driven reinstatement even after accounting for intrinsic scene properties that produced consistent eye movements. These findings confirm predictions of retrieved-context models, suggesting retrieval of temporal context influences complex behaviors generated during naturalistic memory experiences.","tags":["Visual Exploration","Retrieved Context"],"title":"Temporal context guides visual exploration during scene recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James Kragel","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

These processes dynamically interact over rapid timescales, especially when sensory information conflicts with memory. The ability to link hippocampal dynamics to memory-guided behaviors has been limited by experiments that lack the temporal resolution to segregate encoding and retrieval. Here, we simultaneously tracked eye movements and hippocampal field potentials while neurosurgical patients performed a spatial memory task. Phase-locking at the peak of theta preceded fixations to retrieved locations, indicating that the hippocampus coordinates memory-guided eye movements. In contrast, phase-locking at the trough of theta followed fixations to novel object-locations and predicted intact memory of the original location. Theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling increased during fixations to conflicting visual content, but predicted memory updating. Hippocampal theta thus supports learning through two interleaved processes: strengthening encoding of novel information and guiding exploration based on prior experience.","tags":["Visual Exploration"],"title":"Hippocampal theta coordinates memory processing during visual exploration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ganne Chaitanya","Walter Hinds","James Kragel","Xiaosong He","Noah Sideman","Youssef Ezzyat","Michael R Sperling","Ashwini Sharan","Joseph I Tracy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"832a1c03eae4a36396e966323645869e","permalink":"https://jkragel.github.io/publication/2020-01-01_chaitanya2020tonic/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-01-01_chaitanya2020tonic/","section":"publication","summary":"High gamma activity (HGA) of verbal-memory encoding using invasive-electroencephalogram has laid the foundation for numerous studies testing the integrity of memory in diseased populations. Yet, the functional connectivity characteristics of networks subserving these memory linkages remains uncertain. By integrating this electrophysiological biomarker of memory encoding from IEEG with resting-state BOLD fluctuations, we estimated the segregation and hubness of HGA-memory regions in drug-resistant epilepsy patients and matched healthy controls. HGA-memory regions express distinctly different hubness compared to neighboring regions in health and in epilepsy, and this hubness was more relevant than segregation in predicting verbal memory encoding. The HGA-memory network comprised regions from both the cognitive control and primary processing networks, validating that effective verbal-memory encoding requires integrating brain functions, and is not dominated by a central cognitive core. Our results demonstrate a tonic intrinsic set of functional connectivity, which provides the necessary conditions for effective, phasic, task-dependent memory encoding.","tags":[],"title":"Tonic Resting State Hubness Supports High Gamma Activity Defined Verbal Memory Encoding Network in Epilepsy","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

The precise nature of this interaction, however, remains poorly understood. To examine the role of semantic organization during episodic encoding and retrieval, we recorded intracranial encephalographic signals as 69 neurosurgical patients studied and subsequently recalled categorized and unrelated word lists. Applying multivariate classifiers to neural recordings, we were able to reliably predict encoding success, retrieval success, and temporal and categorical clustering during recall. By assessing how these classifiers generalized across list types, we identified specific retrieval processes that predicted recall of categorized lists and distinguished between recall transitions within and between category clusters.

Encoding and retrieval are supported by the engagement of both distinct neural pathways across the cortex and common structures within the medial temporal lobes. However, the degree to which memory performance can be determined by neural processing that is common to encoding and retrieval remains to be determined. To identify neural signatures of successful memory function, we administered a delayed free-recall task to 187 neurosurgical patients implanted with subdural or intraparenchymal depth electrodes. We developed multivariate classifiers to identify patterns of spectral power across the brain that independently predicted successful episodic encoding and retrieval. During encoding and retrieval, patterns of increased high frequency activity in prefrontal, MTL, and inferior parietal cortices, accompanied by widespread decreases in low frequency power across the brain predicted successful memory function. Using a cross-decoding approach, we demonstrate the ability to predict memory function across distinct phases of the free-recall task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that classifiers that combine information from both encoding and retrieval states can outperform task-independent models. These findings suggest that the engagement of a core memory network during either encoding or retrieval shapes the ability to remember the past, despite distinct neural interactions that facilitate encoding and retrieval.","tags":[],"title":"Similar patterns of neural activity predict memory function during encoding and retrieval","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ethan A.

Familiarity processes supporting the correct identification of previously studied probes (in the absence of a recollective response) are associated with activity in anterior medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures including the perirhinal cortex and anterior hippocampus, in addition to lateral prefrontal and dorsal posterior parietal cortex. Here, we address an open question in the cognitive neuroscientific literature: To what extent are these same neurocognitive processes engaged during an internally directed memory search task like free recall? We recorded fMRI activity while participants performed a series of free recall and source recognition trials, and we used a combination of univariate and multivariate analysis techniques to compare neural activation profiles across the two tasks. Univariate analyses showed that posterior MTL regions were commonly associated with recollective processes during source recognition and with free recall responses. Prefrontal and posterior parietal regions were commonly associated with familiarity processes and free recall responses, whereas anterior MTL regions were only associated with familiarity processes during recognition. In contrast with the univariate results, free recall activity patterns characterized using multivariate pattern analysis did not reliably match the neural patterns associated with recollective processes. However, these free recall patterns did reliably match patterns associated with familiarity processes, supporting theories of memory in which common cognitive mechanisms support both item recognition and free recall.","tags":[],"title":"Decoding episodic retrieval processes: Frontoparietal and medial temporal lobe contributions to free recall","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Moore","AD Iordan","Y Hu","James Kragel","S Dolcos","Florin Dolcos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"afd7fdfec494325a6ac6d54ce400197e","permalink":"https://jkragel.github.io/publication/2016-01-01_moore2016localized/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016-01-01_moore2016localized/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite functional brain imaging research pointing to the role of prefrontal cortex in cognitive reappraisal, the structural correlates of habitual engagement of reappraisal are unclear. Functional imaging studies of reappraisal have shown broad engagement of bilateral middle frontal cortex (MFC) and left superior frontal cortex (SFC), and specific engagement of the right SFC. However, volumetric studies have not identified clear associations between reappraisal and these regions. This discrepancy between functional and structural studies suggests that broad functional engagement associated with reappraisal might not be detectable at a structural level using highly localized volumetric measures. This study addressed the discrepant structural findings by assessing the relation between reappraisal and grey matter volume, using methods that allow both region-level broad/diffuse assessments (surface-based morphometry), and voxel-level specific/localized (voxel-based morphometry) measures. Results were consistent with diffuse positive volumetric associations with reappraisal in the right MFC and left SFC, and a localized positive volumetric association in the right SFC, thus resolving the discrepancy between functional and structural studies. This study provides novel evidence supporting the idea that functional engagement related to transient manipulations of reappraisal can be linked to structural associations related to habitual engagement of similar operations, within the same brain regions.","tags":[],"title":"Localized or diffuse: the link between prefrontal cortex volume and cognitive reappraisal","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James Kragel","Sean M Polyn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"9a964e72f465371b106e53fc47fa22bd","permalink":"https://jkragel.github.io/publication/2013-01-01_kragel2013functional/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013-01-01_kragel2013functional/","section":"publication","summary":"Neuroimaging studies have identified two major large-scale brain networks, the default mode network (DMN) and the dorsal attention network (DAN), which are engaged for internally and externally directed cognitive tasks respectively, and which show anticorrelated activity during cognitively demanding tests and at rest. We identified these brain networks using independent component analysis (ICA) of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, and examined their interactions during the free-recall task, a self-initiated memory search task in which retrieval is performed in the absence of external cues. Despite the internally directed nature of the task, the DAN showed transient engagement in the seconds leading up to successful retrieval. ICA revealed a fractionation of the DMN into 3 components. A posteromedial network increased engagement during memory search, while the two others showed suppressed activity during memory search. Cooperative interactions between this posteromedial network, a right-lateralized frontoparietal control network, and a medial prefrontal network were maintained during memory search. The DAN demonstrated heterogeneous task-dependent shifts in functional coupling with various subnetworks within the DMN. This functional reorganization suggests a broader role of the DAN in the absence of externally directed cognition, and highlights the contribution of the posteromedial network to episodic retrieval.","tags":[],"title":"Functional interactions between large-scale networks during memory search","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James Kragel","Neal W Morton","Sean M Polyn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"795b142c2d291fa9603f19b231e86a0f","permalink":"https://jkragel.github.io/publication/2015-01-01_kragel2015neural/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-01-01_kragel2015neural/","section":"publication","summary":"Neural circuitry in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is critically involved in mental time travel, which involves the vivid retrieval of the details of past experience. Neuroscientific theories propose that the MTL supports memory of the past by retrieving previously encoded episodic information, as well as by reactivating a temporal code specifying the position of a particular event within an episode. However, the neural computations supporting these abilities are underspecified. To test hypotheses regarding the computational mechanisms supported by different MTL subregions during mental time travel, we developed a computational model that linked a blood oxygenation level-dependent signal to cognitive operations, allowing us to predict human performance in a memory search task. Activity in the posterior MTL, including parahippocampal cortex, reflected how strongly one reactivates the temporal context of a retrieved memory, allowing the model to predict whether the next memory will correspond to a nearby moment in the study episode. A signal in the anterior MTL, including perirhinal cortex, indicated the successful retrieval of list items, without providing information regarding temporal organization. A hippocampal signal reflected both processes, consistent with theories that this region binds item and context information together to form episodic memories. These findings provide evidence for modern theories that describe complementary roles of the hippocampus and surrounding parahippocampal and perirhinal cortices during the retrieval of episodic memories, shaping how humans revisit the past.","tags":["Retrieved Context"],"title":"Neural activity in the medial temporal lobe reveals the fidelity of mental time travel","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florin Dolcos","Alexandru D Iordan","James Kragel","Jared Stokes","Ryan Campbell","Gregory McCarthy","Roberto Cabeza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"907cf5842d1fcf9786ca4ffe5dfd84a0","permalink":"https://jkragel.github.io/publication/2013-01-01_dolcos2013neural/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013-01-01_dolcos2013neural/","section":"publication","summary":"A fundamental question in the emotional memory literature is why emotion enhances memory in some conditions but disrupts memory in other conditions. For example, separate studies have shown that emotional stimuli tend to be better remembered in long-term episodic memory (EM), whereas emotional distracters tend to impair working memory (WM) maintenance. The first goal of this study was to directly compare the neural correlates of EM enhancement (EME) and WM impairing (WMI) effects, and the second goal was to explore individual differences in these mechanisms. During event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants maintained faces in WM while being distracted by emotional or neutral pictures presented during the delay period. EM for the distracting pictures was tested after scanning and was used to identify successful encoding activity for the picture distracters. The first goal yielded two findings: (1) emotional pictures that disrupted face WM but enhanced subsequent EM were associated with increased amygdala (AMY) and hippocampal activity (ventral system) coupled with reduced dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) activity (dorsal system); (2) trials in which emotion enhanced EM without disrupting WM were associated with increased ventrolateral PFC activity. The ventral-dorsal switch can explain EME and WMI, while the ventrolateral PFC effect suggests a coping mechanism. The second goal yielded two additional findings: (3) participants who were more susceptible to WMI showed greater amygdala increases and PFC reductions; (4) AMY activity increased and dlPFC activity decreased with measures of attentional impulsivity. Taken together, these results clarify the mechanisms linking the enhancing and impairing effects of emotion on memory, and provide insights into the role of individual differences in the impact of emotional distraction.","tags":[],"title":"Neural correlates of opposing effects of emotional distraction on working memory and episodic memory: an event-related FMRI investigation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sean M Polyn","James Kragel","Neal W Morton","Joshua D McCluey","Zachary D Cohen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"550f1a2111a63432164f9a64ceb4dd67","permalink":"https://jkragel.github.io/publication/2012-01-01_polyn2012neural/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012-01-01_polyn2012neural/","section":"publication","summary":"Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is a powerful tool for relating theories of cognitive function to the neural dynamics observed while people engage in cognitive tasks. Here, we use the Context Maintenance and Retrieval model of free recall (CMR; Polyn et al., 2009a) to interpret variability in the strength of task-specific patterns of distributed neural activity as participants study and recall lists of words. The CMR model describes how temporal and source-related (here, encoding task) information combine in a contextual representation that is responsible for guiding memory search. Each studied word in the free-recall paradigm is associated with one of two encoding tasks (size and animacy) that have distinct neural representations during encoding. We find evidence for the context retrieval hypothesis central to the CMR model: Task-specific patterns of neural activity are reactivated during memory search, as the participant recalls an item previously associated with a particular task. Furthermore, we find that the fidelity of these task representations during study is related to task-shifting, the serial position of the studied item, and variability in the magnitude of the recency effect across participants. The CMR model suggests that these effects may be related to a central parameter of the model that controls the rate that an internal contextual representation integrates information from the surrounding environment.","tags":["Retrieved Context"],"title":"The neural dynamics of task context in free recall","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Scott M Hayes","Norbou Buchler","Jared Stokes","James Kragel","Roberto Cabeza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"02b2cc8ad0d3c96f04ec1abc1e3fbc4c","permalink":"https://jkragel.github.io/publication/2011-01-01_hayes2011neural/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011-01-01_hayes2011neural/","section":"publication","summary":"Although the medial-temporal lobes (MTL), PFC, and parietal cortex are considered primary nodes in the episodic memory network, there is much debate regarding the contributions of MTL, PFC, and parietal subregions to recollection versus familiarity (dual-process theory) and the feasibility of accounts on the basis of a single memory strength process (strength theory). To investigate these issues, the current fMRI study measured activity during retrieval of memories that differed quantitatively in terms of strength (high vs. low-confidence trials) and qualitatively in terms of recollection versus familiarity (source vs. item memory tasks). Support for each theory varied depending on which node of the episodic memory network was considered. Results from MTL best fit a dual-process account, as a dissociation was found between a right hippocampal region showing high-confidence activity during the source memory task and bilateral rhinal regions showing high-confidence activity during the item memory task. Within PFC, several left-lateralized regions showed greater activity for source than item memory, consistent with recollective orienting, whereas a right-lateralized ventrolateral area showed low-confidence activity in both tasks, consistent with monitoring processes. Parietal findings were generally consistent with strength theory, with dorsal areas showing low-confidence activity and ventral areas showing high-confidence activity in both tasks. This dissociation fits with an attentional account of parietal functions during episodic retrieval. The results suggest that both dual-process and strength theories are partly correct, highlighting the need for an integrated model that links to more general cognitive theories to account for observed neural activity during episodic memory retrieval.","tags":[],"title":"Neural correlates of confidence during item recognition and source memory retrieval: evidence for both dual-process and strength memory theories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Cabeza","Yonatan S Mazuz","Jared Stokes","James Kragel","Marty G Woldorff","Elisa Ciaramelli","Ingrid R Olson","Morris Moscovitch"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"33dd0aa1075fc3b6c66f251926621dc4","permalink":"https://jkragel.github.io/publication/2011-01-01_cabeza2011overlapping/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011-01-01_cabeza2011overlapping/","section":"publication","summary":"The specific role of different parietal regions to episodic retrieval is a topic of intense debate. According to the Attention to Memory (AtoM) model, dorsal parietal cortex (DPC) mediates top‚Äìdown attention processes guided by retrieval goals, whereas ventral parietal cortex (VPC) mediates bottom‚Äìup attention processes captured by the retrieval output or the retrieval cue. This model also hypothesizes that the attentional functions of DPC and VPC are similar for memory and perception. To investigate this last hypothesis, we scanned participants with event-related fMRI whereas they performed memory and perception tasks, each comprising an orienting phase (top‚Äìdown attention) and a detection phase (bottom‚Äìup attention). The study yielded two main findings. First, consistent with the AtoM model, orienting-related activity for memory and perception overlapped in DPC, whereas detection-related activity for memory and perception overlapped in VPC. The DPC overlap was greater in the left intraparietal sulcus, and the VPC overlap in the left TPJ. Around overlapping areas, there were differences in the spatial distribution of memory and perception activations, which were consistent with trends reported in the literature. Second, both DPC and VPC showed stronger connectivity with medial-temporal lobe during the memory task and with visual cortex during the perception task. These findings suggest that, during memory tasks, some parietal regions mediate similar attentional control processes to those involved in perception tasks (orienting in DPC vs. detection in VPC), although on different types of information (mnemonic vs. sensory).","tags":[],"title":"Overlapping parietal activity in memory and perception: evidence for the attention to memory model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon W Davis","James Kragel","David J Madden","Roberto Cabeza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"f4d182be373eac43703e4c129d3da4c0","permalink":"https://jkragel.github.io/publication/2011-01-01_davis2011architecture/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011-01-01_davis2011architecture/","section":"publication","summary":"Contralateral recruitment remains a controversial phenomenon in both the clinical and normative populations.
